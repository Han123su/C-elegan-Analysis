# C-elegan-Analysis

### Description
This project focuses on tracking the motion trajectories of C. elegans through image analysis techniques, with an emphasis on the dynamic behavior of specific neurons (CEP, ADE, PDE). By utilizing feature matching and motion prediction methods, combined with multi-faceted evaluations of brightness, target size, and dynamic positioning, the project achieves precise tracking and visualization of fluorescently labeled neuronal markers, demonstrating capabilities in biological image processing and neural behavior analysis.
